# fractal-tree


This is a quick and dirty little Python script that spawns a tkinter window with a canvas that draws a fractal tree with a terminally recursive function. It is fun to mess around with.

## Controls
`Mouse`: It controls both height and branch angle of the tree. Vertical movement controls the individual length of the branches, and horizontal movement controls the angle of said branches.  
`Q,A`: Controls the branch line thickness  
`W,S`: Controls the factor by which successive branches are lengthened or shortened. 
`Arrow up,Arrow down`: They control the number of recursion levels of the tree.  
**WARNING:** It can get very slow fast, but if you feel like having a space heater in the cold it might not be a bad idea.  
`Arrow left, Arrow right`: They switch the color palette of the tree.  

**HINT:** At a specific shortening factor, recursion depth, and color palette you can get a beautiful ðŸŒ¸cherry blossom treeðŸŒ¸
## Requirements
A little fractal sun, a little fractal water and some nutritious fractal earth :).
## Usage

## Might do:
- [ ] Canvas resize on window resize
- [ ] Clean up index handling
